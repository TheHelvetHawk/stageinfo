CS internship at Centre Oscar Lambret - Department of Physics


## EBT3_ConvertToDose.ipynb
Takes a TIFF image of a gafchromic filter and converts it to irradiation dose and checks for the zone with the highest concentration
of dose.


## EBT3_Calibration.ipynb
Takes a list of dose calibration TIFF images (pictures must be similar basically they must be taken in a burst),
locates the areas of interest and creates a graphical view of each color channel's optical density.


## EBT3_CalibrationWithFitting.ipynb
Similar to EBT3_Calibration.ipynb but the curves are fitted (pretty much a V2.0 of the other file)



PS : For command-line usage of the programs, i can't know how it works at the moment due to technical issues. 
Though you can use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try) to execute it
